Chapter 4. 积极的环境改变人。

要做实践的理想主义者。

Study最好的，是优秀大众化。
We can make a difference.

改变是指数式的。微笑可以传染。Pay it forward, so on and so on.
Exponential function.
电影：让爱传出去 Pay It Forward (2000)

光凭外因，很难改变人的幸福感。

Frankly, my level of happiness is low since 2017.

Story: interviewing Professors before the tenure decision.
A life time.
Devastating. 毁灭性的，一败涂地的。
After decision. 3 months later, 6 months later.

Those who got tenured or did not get tenured,
went back to their previous level of well-being.

External circumstances makes very little difference for happiness.
居住地点的影响也很小。真的吗？

"If you can't run with the big dogs, stay in the yard." 这是什么典故？

where we are, where we live.
income levels, lottery, tenure.
getting into our dream college.
getting our dream job.

Spike -> base level.

外部环境是 民主社会 还是 专制社会。

Bad news. Why do I work hard?
Lower expectation, lower stress. (But not in the long term.)

Question is the Right v.s. Wrong expectations.

Wrong expectation: expect that  getting into a certain place, getting a raise,
finding our dream partner is responsible for our happiness.
Moving to California.

Right expectation: believe in change from within.
These things will not make us happy.
In fact, our readiness and potential to experience happiness is mostly
depended on our state of mind.
Not on our status, or the state of our bank account.

It's about
- change our perception of the world.
- change our interpretation of what's happening to us, of our achievements,
  of our failure

书名，A Conflict of Visions. 愿景的冲突。

Constraint view ( Tal belief) "人性约束观"
Human nature is fixed.
- We have inclinations.
- We have certain instincts that are there and have been formed either
  God-given or Evolutionary-given for millions of years to be formed.
- They are not going to change any time soon. Not in our life time.
- It's fixed. We are stuck with them, for good and ill.

All we can do after we accept this nature, is to
- first understand it through research
- then, make the best use of it.

人性约束观
The permission to be a human. 做一个凡人的权利。
A space, to be human.

Not resignation
It's Active Acceptance.

Affect - emotion.
Behavior - action.
Cognition - thought.

Envy is part of human nature. We all experience it. Be generous in action.

Our psychological immune system will become stronger.

冥想练习。

Celebrate our breath.

Remind yourselves just once or twice:
- give yourself the permission, give others the same permission.
- you deserve it.
