Information in container.
Transform it. Focus. Interpretation.
E.g.
People has more than they need. People who have little.
People who celebrate life. People who feel disaster.

Interpretation matters a lot more than the Information.
Happiness, state of mind.

Chipping away the excess stone. Getting rid of limitations, of barriers.
Fear of failures. (We didn't have as kids).
Perfectionism. Debilitating and often hurts us.
Chipping away our ability for success. Maybe we are afraid of success.

Soul grows more by subtraction than addition.
Limitations are preventing us from fulfilling our potential.

We have potential born with us.
But external voice, with being part of our culture. Limitations on top of us.

Knowledge is about information.
Wisdom is about transformation.
Wow factor. There is no wow.
Common sense is that common.
